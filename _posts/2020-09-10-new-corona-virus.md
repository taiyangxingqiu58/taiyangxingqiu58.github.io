To build a Globien word, we use the "English/French Word + Chinese Pinyin" form. Let's have a look:

* new/novel：new + xin = nine  （-e indicates an adjective word）
* crown/corona：corona + guan = koronuan (c changed to k according to the pronunciation)
* virus：virus + du = viru

Let's connect them, and get the phrase in Globien:

**nine koronuan viru**

Quite simple, right? Though the words have been changed in some way, they're still very easy to be recognized by an Indo-European language speaker, especially an English speaker.

The changed part, word rhyme, is helpful for Chinese speakers.  It's still a little bit hard for Chinese though.  To help more, Globien has another style for biginners from Chinese speakers:  

**nin<sup>x</sup>e koronuan<sup>g</sup> viru<sup>d</sup>**

The superscript is not a portion of a word.  It's just a hint.  An Indo-European speaker call always ignore them safely.

By the way, the expression for "pandemic" is: **gronde infekanze malindeo**.  It's a little bit long, but as an IAL and for the sake of simpleness, Globien won't build too many words as that in English.  Also, an Indo-European speaker can easily recognize this phrase.
